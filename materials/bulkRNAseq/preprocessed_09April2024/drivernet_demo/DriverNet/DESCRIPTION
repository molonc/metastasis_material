Description: DriverNet is a package to predict functional important
        driver genes in cancer by integrating genome data (mutation and
        copy number variation data) and transcriptome data (gene
        expression data). The different kinds of data are combined by
        an influence graph, which is a gene-gene interaction network
        deduced from pathway data. A greedy algorithm is used to find
        the possible driver genes, which may mutated in a larger number
        of patients and these mutations will push the gene expression
        values of the connected genes to some extreme values.
